# exercise 1
# A bank found that the average number of cars waiting during the noon 
# hour at a drive-up window follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2 cars. 
# Make a chart of this distribution and answer these questions concerning the 
# probability of cars waiting at the drive-up window.
# 1a. What is the probability that no cars drive up in the noon hour?
# 1b. What is the probability that 3 or more cars come through the drive through?
# 1c. How likely is it that the drive through gets at least 1 car?
